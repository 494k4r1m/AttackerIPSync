# QRadar & MISP Integration/Automation üõ°Ô∏è

This repository provides a simple yet powerful **Python-based integration** between **QRadar** and **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**.

## üéØ Goal
The goal of this tool is to streamline the process of:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Extracting **IP addresses** and **URLs** associated with offenses from QRadar.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Allowing a human analyst to **approve or reject** the data for further action.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding approved attributes dynamically to **MISP events**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Automatically **publishing the updated MISP event** for broader visibility.

## üîß How It Works
‚Ä¢ **QRadar Offenses**: The script connects to QRadar and fetches offenses containing threat indicators.  
‚Ä¢ **Approval Interface**: Displays IPs and URLs for an analyst to approve using a simple input interface.  
‚Ä¢ **MISP Integration**: Adds approved indicators to a specified MISP event.  
‚Ä¢ **Publish Events**: Publishes the updated MISP event automatically.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy and Security Notice
This script is designed with modularity and privacy in mind. No hardcoded sensitive data is included in the repository. You must provide your **QRadar API**, **MISP API tokens**, and other configurations locally. Please handle your credentials securely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `requests`, `json`, etc.

## üìù Disclaimer
This project is provided as-is. It is not affiliated with QRadar or MISP and should be used responsibly within the boundaries of your organization's security policies.
